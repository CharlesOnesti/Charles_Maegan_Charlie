Our machine learning algorithm authenticates banknotes.
We trained our program with a dataset that associated four input variables with the authenticity of the banknote.
1. variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
3. curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
4. entropy of image (continuous)

This project was interesting because it can be used to combat fraud.
We had fun putting the program together.
